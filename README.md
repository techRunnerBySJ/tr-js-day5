Question: How do you handle errors in JavaScript?
Answer: Errors in JavaScript can be handled using try, catch, and finally blocks. try contains the code that might throw an error, catch catches the error if it occurs, and finally executes code that should be run regardless of whether an error was thrown or not.

to run use command : node app.js
